Within this project we are interested in finding, structuring and investigating data on the owners of Swedish forest. 
As a large share of surface area in Sweden is covered by forest, having a key role in many socio-ecological relationships,
we are curious to find out more about ownership structures. 

Some data sources within reports are attached. 


Current status:
•	There is apparently only one report made public, but it seems they have some more reports or data. 
We might want to check up with Stefan Karlsson (stefan.karlsson@skogsstyrelsen.se) who is referred to as a contact for further data
•	Available report is downloaded within this folder, referred to as: forest_ownership.pdf
•	Most detailed data can be found in their database:
